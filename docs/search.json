We present results from exploratory data summaries, ANOVA tests, and regression models, accompanied by visualizations that clarify each step of the analysis.\n\n\nSeverity Classification and Summary Statistics\n\nFire severity was classified into three groups based on radial growth rates: Low (&lt;250 m/day), Moderate (250–700 m/day), and High (&gt;700 m/day). Table 1 summarizes the mean radial growth, fire area, actual evapotranspiration (AET), water deficit (DEF), and sample size within each severity class. High-severity fires exhibited the highest mean radial growth (1589 m/day) and were associated with the largest burned areas (3432 ha), whereas low-severity fires had the smallest growth and area.\n\n\nTo visualize the relationship between water availability and fire severity, we plotted AET and DEF by severity class (Figures 1 and 2). Figure 1 presents a boxplot of AET across severity classes, showing a decreasing trend in AET as severity increases. Figure 2 displays a similar pattern for DEF, with high-severity fires generally experiencing higher water deficits. These patterns suggest that drier environmental conditions are associated with more intense fires.\n\n\nTo statistically validate these observations, we conducted ANOVA tests to assess whether AET and DEF differ significantly by severity class. Test 1 shows that both AET (F(2, 63840) = 218.3, p &lt; 0.001) and DEF (F(2, 63840) = 68.91, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly different across severity levels. These results confirm that areas with lower water availability and higher moisture stress are more prone to high-severity fires.\n\n\n\nVegetation Type and Fire Severity\n\nTo explore whether vegetation types are associated with fire severity, we integrated a separate vegetation dataset. A sample of 10 vegetation classes is shown in a preview table, highlighting the diversity of plant communities in the study area. We randomly assigned EVT classes to fire observations (for exploratory purposes) and assessed severity distribution by class.\n\n\nFigure 3 visualizes the proportional distribution of severity levels across vegetation types using a stacked bar chart. While some differences in the proportion of high-severity fires appear across vegetation classes, the variation is modest. To formally test this relationship, Test 2 uses a one-way ANOVA to determine if mean radial growth (a proxy for severity) significantly varies across EVT classes. The result was not statistically significant (F(19, 63823) = 1.236, p = 0.217), suggesting that vegetation type does not play a dominant role in determining fire severity in this dataset.\n\n\nWe also calculated mean AET and DEF by vegetation class to assess whether different ecosystems experience different water balance conditions. Figure 4 presents a table summarizing mean AET and DEF for 20 vegetation classes. Results show relatively little variation across types, with no clear vegetation group standing out as markedly wetter or drier than others.\n\n\n\nSeverity, Time Since Fire, and Recovery\n\nTo explore the effect of time since fire on recovery, we examined radial growth as a function of days since ignition. Figure 5 displays a scatterplot of radial growth versus days burned, colored by severity. A linear smoothing line for each severity class shows that growth generally increases over time, especially in high-severity fires. This suggests that, despite initial high impact, severe fires can experience substantial growth given enough time.\n\n\nTo better understand ecosystem recovery, we created a binary variable where growth &gt;500 m/day indicates “recovered” status. Figure 6 illustrates the proportion of recovered versus non-recovered observations across severity classes. Low-severity fires showed the highest proportion of recovery, while high-severity fires had the lowest, indicating that severity negatively impacts recovery likelihood.\n\n\nTo quantify these patterns, Test 3 applies a logistic regression model predicting recovery based on severity class, AET, and DEF. The model showed that AET (β = -0.0029, p = 0.0018) and DEF (β = -0.0023, p &lt; 0.0001) were significant predictors of recovery, with higher water availability associated with greater odds of recovery. Interestingly, severity class coefficients were not statistically significant, which may be due to collinearity with water balance variables or insufficient model complexity.\n\n\nThis analysis revealed three main findings. First, fire severity is strongly linked to water balance—more severe fires happen in drier areas, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 and confirmed by Test 1. Second, vegetation type does not significantly affect fire severity (Figure 3, Test 2), suggesting that climate factors like moisture are more important than fuel type. Third, recovery after fire is better predicted by environmental stress, especially water availability, rather than fire severity alone (Figures 5 and 6, Test 3). Overall, the results support the idea that climate, especially water stress, plays a major role in fire behavior and recovery in Oregon ecosystems."
